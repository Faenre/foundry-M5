This system is for playing Mage: the Ascension 5th edition on the Foundry Virtual Tabletop System. 

The ruleset is not official, but is a derivation of the M20 setting and content mixed with a "V5-like" rule adaptation. The rules were put together by [EnterElysium](https://www.patreon.com/EnterElysium), and are played out in their Youtube channels, [Roll4It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrgHWdN6BIk) and [EnterElysium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfDE7QoITe4&list=PLR5ZBfGW6e1m_-26kz65g9hTNtZm1Uxzm). This is an implementation of their rules, but since their rules are only available to patreon members, I'll respect that and simply point towards their resources.

They made awesome rules! Go support them!
