This system is for playing EnterElysium's _Mage: the Ascension_ fan-made 5th edition hack on the Foundry Virtual Tabletop System. 

The ruleset is not official, but is a derivation of the M20 setting and content mixed with a "V5-like" rule adaptation. The rules were put together by [EnterElysium](https://www.patreon.com/EnterElysium), and are played out in their Youtube channels, [Roll4It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrgHWdN6BIk) and [EnterElysium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfDE7QoITe4&list=PLR5ZBfGW6e1m_-26kz65g9hTNtZm1Uxzm). 

This is an implementation of [EE's rules](https://www.patreon.com/posts/mage-rules-and-54925826), with a couple of new adjustments from our campaign: Technocratic spheres can be accessed in the Options pane of a Mage character, and Mage-Vampire hybrids can exist too, also available in the Options pane. Also, some skills were adjusted to account for things like Hypertech and Pilot. If you don't like the skills, you can adjust them in the `template.json`.

Roll4It/EE made awesome rules! And awesome Let's Plays! Go support them!
